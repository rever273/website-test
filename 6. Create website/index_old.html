        <p>VR lets users interact with 3D environments and objects, creating a sense of immersion that's unparalleled by
            other mediums.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although this may seem extremely futuristic, its origins are not as recent as we might think. In fact, many
            people consider that one of the first Virtual Reality devices was called Sensorama, a machine with a
            built-in seat that played 3D movies, gave off odours and generated vibrations to make the experience as
            vivid as possible. .</p>
        <br>
        <p>All this means that Virtual Reality is no longer science fiction. It is integrated into our present and, in
            the coming years, it will lead to advances that will shape the future.</p>
